> Download releases of jpillora/chisel, a tool to create tcp-tunnels.

[Chisel](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel) is a software written in Go that starts TCP-tunnels. It is a single binary that can be downloaded and started.

- As a server, it will listen on a port for incoming connections.
- As a client, it will connect to a chisel server and open a tunnel, similar to ssh port-forwarding.

The goal of this project is to **download a specific version of chisel** from the github-releases, matching your current architecture, in order to let you use it.

My specific goal is to use it as a reverse-tunnel to allow connections from a selenium-server to a local build-server in Gitlab-CI or docker-compose.

![](docs/reverse-tunnel.png)

Such a reverse-tunnel can be achieved by running

```bash
chisel server -p 2222 --reverse
```

in the selenium docker-container. Then you can run

```bash
chisel client selenium:2222 R:6006:localhost:6006
```

to initiate the tunnel. Requests `http://localhost:6006` on the selenium machine will then be forwarded to wherever you started your `chisel client`

# Installation

```
npm install chisel-tunnel
```

# Usage

The following example demonstrates how to use this module:

```js
const chiselTunnel = require("chisel-tunnel");
const cp = require("child_process");

chiselTunnel.downloadChisel("~1.5.0").then(filename => {
  cp.spawnSync(filename, ["--version"], { stdio: "inherit" });
});
```

This will generate the following output

```

```
