[Chisel](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel) is a software written in Go that starts TCP-tunnels.
It is a single binary that can be downloaded and started.

* As a server, it will listen on a port for incoming connections.
* As a client, it will connect to a chisel server and open a tunnel, similar to ssh port-forwarding.

The goal of this project is to **download a specific version of chisel** from the github-releases, matching your current
architecture, in order to let you use it.

My specific goal is to use it as a reverse-tunnel to allow connections from a selenium-server to a local build-server
in Gitlab-CI or docker-compose.

Such a reverse-tunnel can be achieved by running

```bash
chisel server -p 2222 --reverse
```

in the selenium docker-container. Then you can run

```bash
chisel client selenium:2222 R:6006:localhost:6006
```

to initiate the tunnel. Requests `http://localhost:6006` on the selenium machine
will then be forwarded to wherever you started your `chisel client`
